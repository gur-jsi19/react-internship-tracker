# Internship Tracker

This is a React project I built to track my internship applications for Summer 2026.

It lets me store the companies I applied to, their status, and some notes, all in one place.  
The data is saved in the browser so it does not disappear when I refresh.

## Why I built this

I am a computer science student preparing for internships.  
I wanted a simple tool to manage all my job applications and also practice building a real React app.

This project helped me learn:
- routing with React Router
- managing state
- working with forms
- saving data in localStorage
